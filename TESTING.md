# Testing Plan for Bibliophile

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Bibliophile application to ensure a high-quality, bug-free user experience.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Objective**: To test individual components and functions in isolation.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Scope**:
  - **UI Components**: Test rendering, state changes, and event handling for all components (Buttons, Cards, Modals, etc.).
  - **Utility Functions**: Test any utility functions, such as date formatting or data transformation.
  - **Validation Schemas**: Test Zod schemas to ensure they correctly validate and invalidate data.

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Objective**: To test the interaction between different components and modules.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, Mock Service Worker (MSW)
- **Scope**:
  - **Form Submissions**: Test form submissions with server actions, including success and error states.
  - **Authentication Flow**: Test the entire authentication flow, from sign-up to sign-out.
  - **Data Fetching and Display**: Test that data is fetched correctly and displayed in the UI (e.g., book list, pagination).

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Objective**: To test the application from the user's perspective, simulating real user scenarios.
- **Tools**: Cypress or Playwright
- **Scope**:
  - **User Journeys**: Test common user journeys, such as:
    - Signing up for a new account
    - Signing in and out
    - Adding, editing, and deleting a book
    - Searching and filtering the book list
  - **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure the application works correctly on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
  - **Responsive Design Testing**: Test the application on different screen sizes to ensure it is fully responsive.

## Testing Priorities

1. **Critical Path**: Focus on the most critical user journeys, such as authentication and core CRUD operations.
2. **High-Impact Features**: Prioritize testing features that have the most impact on the user experience, such as search and filtering.
3. **Edge Cases**: Test for edge cases and potential error states, such as invalid form submissions or network errors.

## Manual Testing

- **Objective**: To manually test the application to catch any issues that may have been missed by automated tests.
- **Scope**:
  - **Exploratory Testing**: Manually explore the application to identify any unexpected behavior or usability issues.
  - **Visual Testing**: Manually check the UI for any visual inconsistencies or design flaws.
  - **Accessibility Testing**: Manually test the application for accessibility issues, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Performance Testing

- **Objective**: To ensure the application is fast and responsive.
- **Tools**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- **Scope**:
  - **Page Load Speed**: Measure the time it takes for pages to load and become interactive.
  - **Bundle Size**: Analyze the size of the application bundle to identify any opportunities for optimization.
  - **API Response Times**: Measure the time it takes for API requests to complete.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Objective**: To automate the testing process and ensure that all tests are run on every code change.
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions
- **Scope**:
  - **Run Tests on Pull Requests**: Automatically run all unit and integration tests on every pull request.
  - **Linting and Code Style Checks**: Enforce consistent code style and identify potential issues with ESLint.

By following this testing plan, we can ensure that Bibliophile is a high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly application.
